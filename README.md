# Device Authority for iOS

In [our blog post](https://blog.sidetrack.app/debugging-in-production) we discussed the ability to create configuration profiles on iOS to secure access to certain functionality. This acts as a form of keycard, allowing the right people access to the right areas - useful for both indie developers and large companies who want to grant access to debug menus to employees only.

This Swift package aims to make it as easy as possible to adopt this pattern, building on top of the step-by-step instructions we published in [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/Sherlouk/ba24f6366cd2cb1f9ad9c400ca18ad09).

## Usage

> Coming soon. This package have not been fully completed, or tested, and so we recommend using the instructions in the Gist above.
